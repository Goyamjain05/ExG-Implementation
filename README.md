Integration of Point and Raster Data Visualization with Point Extraction
Step 1: Displaying Point and Raster Data on a Matplotlib Plot To provide a visual representation of both point and raster data, a Matplotlib plot was generated. This plot showcases the spatial distribution of the points of interest overlaid on the raster image.

Step 2: Selecting Raster Band (Green)
A specific band (green band) was selected from the raster dataset for subsequent analysis. This band contains valuable information regarding the vegetation present in the agricultural fields.

Step 3: Extracting Point Values from Raster
Point values were extracted from the raster dataset corresponding to the locations of interest identified in the point data. This extraction process involved converting geographic coordinates to row and column indices within the raster grid.

Step 4: Visualizing Points of Interest on Green Band Images
The points of interest extracted from the raster dataset were visualized on the green band images. This visualization aids in assessing the vegetation characteristics surrounding each point, providing valuable insights for further analysis.
